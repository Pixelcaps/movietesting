Thingtesting Tech Movie Assignment
-> I have choosen to bootstrap this project with Next.js because it is used at Thingtesting as well. Considering the complexity of the assignment, a more lightweight option like CRA would have worked as well.
-> I have omitted to add any comments due to the fact that I would have mostly described exactly the requirements from the email. In terms on development, besides the main features, I have also added genres to filter movies and a reviews section.
-> As Oscar Wilde once said, 'Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery'. I have tried my best at recreating the Thingtesting design language system (Have to say, I would not consider design my strong suit). The cast and crew sections use a style similar to the 'Similar brands' section from Thingtesting.
-> If I were to spend more time on this assignment, I would add a few simple components to display error messages in case of bad responses from the API and I would break down some of the existing components into smaller ones.
